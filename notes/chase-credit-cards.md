Once enabled, you will need to authorize this client. First, you must attempt
a login, either by trying to list accounts or some other remote operation. You
will receive the following error message:

```
Please verify your identity within the next 7 days. Using your desktop
computer, go to your banks website and visit the Secure Message Center for
instructions.

```

Now you can enable access for your application. Go to the 'Secure Message
Center':
